[[<id>]]

|======================
|Replace                |With                               | Notes
|`<id>`                 |The term in lowercase.             |If the term consists of more than one word, separate them with a hyphen ("-"). Do not use spaces, capital letters, or special characters (for example, slash "/") in the ID. If two entries could possibly have the same ID, see xref:two-entries-with-same-ID[What to do if two entries have the same ID?]
|`<term>`               |The term to be described.          |
|`<description>`        |The description of the term.|Use full sentences with periods. If a term has more than one meaning, use numbers to separate them. For an example, see the xref:media[media] entry. Add information about why we should use the term in this form. If we should not use the term, explain why. Alternatively, explain why the terms listed in the *Incorrect forms* field are incorrect.
|`<yes/no/with caution>`|"yes" if the term should be used.

"no" if the term should not be used.

"with caution" if the term should be used sporadically or only in certain cases.|Explain why we should or should not use the term in the *Description* field.
|`<class>`              |The part of speech of the term.|Possible values: noun, verb, adjective, adverb, pronoun, conjunction, preposition. Use noun for acronyms or abbreviations. Leave the field empty for symbols.
|`<incorrect-form>`     |The form of the term that we should not use.|If there are multiple incorrect forms, separate them with a comma (",").
|`<another-term-id>`    |The ID of another term related to this one.|Always verify that this ID already exists in the document; otherwise, it will fail to validate if the ID does not exist. Do not include a space between `<another-term-id>` and `[<another-term>]`.
|`<another-term>`       |The term related to this one.|To link to another document or a web page, replace `xref:<another-term-id>[<another-term>]` with `<link>[<name-of-the-document/web-page>]`.
|======================

[IMPORTANT]
====
* Do not combine two terms into one entry.

* Keep all fields, even if a field is empty. An empty field serves as a placeholder if the field is required later.

* Use quotation marks on the first occurrence of a term in the *Description* field. Do not include an acronym in parentheses within the quotation marks; for example, "Asynchronous Transfer Mode" (ATM) is a network technology based on transferring data in cells or packets of a fixed size.

* If the *Description* field contains more than one paragraph, only the last paragraph is displayed in the Atom linter's text. Ensure that word usage advice is contained in the last paragraph.

* Use single lines with no breaks for each paragraph. That is, in a text editor, it looks like this:
+
----
1   *Description*: This text is on a single
*   line with no line breaks.
----
+
Instead of this:
+
----
1   *Description*: This text is broken
2   across multiple lines.
----

* If the term has a correct and an incorrect form, always use the correct form instead of `<term>` and list the incorrect form in the *Incorrect forms* field. Remember to explain why the incorrect form is incorrect in the *Description* field.

* If you want to add a term that we should not use and that does not have a correct form, use the incorrect version instead of `<term>` and add "no" to the *Use it* field. Explain why we should not use that term in the *Description* field.

* If you want to list a term in the _Product-specific Conventions_ chapter that is already included in the _General Conventions_ chapter, add the product-specific meaning to the *Description* field of the term in _General Conventions_. Use numbers to separate the meanings. In _Product-specific Conventions_ add the following boilerplate text with a link to the entry in _General Conventions_:
+
----
==== <term> (<class>)
See xref:<id-in-general-conventions>[<term>] in the _General Conventions_ chapter.
