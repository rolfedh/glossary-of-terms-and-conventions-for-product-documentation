== General Information

This document is the central location for terms and conventions for technical language in Red Hat's product documentation and other technical content. It was created by the Documentation Conventions project team as part of the Customer Content Services FY17 Quality Initiative, and supplements _The IBM Style Guide_, which is the main reference for technical terms and conventions used at Red Hat.

While several other resources also define technical terms and conventions, this document was created to be an official resource maintained by Red Hat Customer Content Services that is easy to update and maintain, that contains all of the general and product-specific terms used by documentation teams, and that is available to all associates at Red Hat. This document has incorporated all the terms in the _Writing Style Guide_, with the exception of those that appear in _The IBM Style Guide_ already, and also includes terms specific to Red Hat products.

Several general and product-specific terms have been added already, but this document is still a work in progress, and all associates and community members are encouraged to make contributions at any time.
