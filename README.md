## What is the Purpose of the Glossary of Terms and Conventions for Product Documentation?

The purpose of the Documentation Conventions project is to define and apply a set of technical language conventions used by all documentation teams at Red Hat that will improve the consistency of language across Red Hat documentation. The Glossary of Terms and Convention for Product Documentation contains general and product-specific terms. Please help us expand the glossary if you notice any terms that are missing.


## Why Are We Doing This?

The project aims to create a central document that outlines conventions for technical terminology and Red Hat product-specific naming that will be used by all of the CCS documentation teams. It also aims to establish a long-term process for maintaining and developing the document.
